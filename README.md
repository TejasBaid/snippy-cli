# üìù Snippy - A Simple CLI for Managing Code Snippets (v1.0.0)

Snippy is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing code snippets efficiently. With Snippy, you can create, edit, copy, and delete snippets right from your terminal. It's designed to help developers quickly store and retrieve useful code snippets, all while keeping things simple and straightforward.

## üöÄ Features
- üìÇ **Create, list, and manage snippets** easily.
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Open snippets** in your preferred text editor.
- üìã **Copy snippets** directly to the clipboard.
- üóëÔ∏è **Delete snippets** when they are no longer needed.

## üì¶ Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Snippy is from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/snippy-cli/). Just run the following command:

```bash
pip install snippy-cli
```

This will install **snippy-cli** and its dependencies, making it available as a command-line tool that you can run directly.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually, you can clone the repository and install the package locally.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TejasBaid/snippy-cli.git
   cd snippy-cli
   ```

2. **Install the package**:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

> **Note**: Make sure you have Python 3.x and `pip` installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once installed, Snippy can be used directly from the terminal using the `snip` command.

### Example Commands:

- **Create a new snippet**:
   ```bash
   snip create my_snippet
   ```
   This command opens your default text editor to create a snippet. The snippet will be saved in the `Snippets/` directory.

- **List all snippets**:
   ```bash
   snip list
   ```

- **Open a snippet for editing**:
   ```bash
   snip open my_snippet
   ```

- **Copy a snippet to the clipboard**:
   ```bash
   snip copy my_snippet
   ```

- **Delete a snippet**:
   ```bash
   snip delete my_snippet
   ```

- **Display help**:
   ```bash
   snip help
   ```

### Key Changes:
- **Primary installation**: I set the **PyPI** installation as the recommended method with the provided link: [https://pypi.org/project/snippy-cli/](https://pypi.org/project/snippy-cli/).
- **Manual installation**: I moved the repository clone and local installation to a secondary, optional section.

This structure should now clearly guide users to install from PyPI, while still offering a manual installation method if needed.

Let me know if any other adjustments are needed!
